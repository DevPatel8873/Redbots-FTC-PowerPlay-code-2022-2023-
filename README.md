# Redbots-FTC-PowerPlay-code-2022-2023-
FTC Powerplay code for the Redbots robotics team from 2022-2023. Contains autonomous and teleop programs written in OnBot Java.

Robotics code written in OnBot Java for the FTC PowerPlay season. Contains the code for 2 different robots our team made for the season with its own sets of hardware, teleop, and autonomous code files. Support for the use of multiple sensors including motor encoders, IMU, color sensors, magnetic limit switches, and a webcam.

This file only contains the WRITTEN code for this season. None of the gradle files or other files created by FTC are included. Assuming that you already have the FtcRobotController files installed and running in Android Studio you can drag these files directly into your teamcode folder to view the code in android studio. If you do not have the FtcRobotController files installed already, set that up first with android studio then you can use these files. I have included the link to that repository below.
